# TicTacToe
Simple TicTacToe game made in C++

(There is a lot of overcomplicated nonsense code that can be easily replaced with simplier implementations. Wrote this in one CS class that was boring)

(**Not Unbeatable Yet**)

There a lot of bugs and edge cases
Might fix them later on

You must at least have a c++ compiler that is version c++11 or above

compile using


g++ main.cpp game.cpp

Run using

**./a.exe for Windows**


**./a.out for MacOS & Linux**
